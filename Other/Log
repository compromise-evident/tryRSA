tryRSA



Version 2.0.1   Randomness is now seeded from Unix time only;  had to remove RAM
                garbage as randomness supplement due to  Linux now  zeroing  RAM
                before allocating  it to a process,  and zeroing that  RAM after
                freeing that process. See kernel:  init_on_alloc,  init_on_free.
                User may now insert a seed to verify that some factorization was
                done by tryRSA. Now what's saved to file:  seed, and the runtime
                in seconds.  Factor now printed even if greater than 400 digits.

Version 2.0.0   No file input,  RNG is duplicate-free,  good for multi-instance.

Version 1.0.0   Quite efficient for an  algorithm with random candidate factors.
