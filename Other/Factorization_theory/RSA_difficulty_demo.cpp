/* Prints which two numbers multiplied recreate n last digits of your semiprime.          Run it: "apt install g++ geany". Open this in Geany. Hit F9 once. F5 to run.
Increase the number of semiprime digits you want recreated.  Listed p*q are the
plausible ending digits of the factors.  Modify semiprime ending digits as well.

It seems impossible to know any semiprime factor digit, unless you have a factor
whole.  You cannot eliminate  any factor (plaus)ibilities because  multiplicands
and multipliers listed are simply all numbers ending in 1, 3, 7, 9. For example,
given the last few digits of semiprime pq,  primes p are listed as every integer
1+ but ending in 1, 3, 7, & 9  (as primes should, other than 2 & 5.) Now, for q,
the same exact numbers are listed as multipliers for p, in a different order. */
